        <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
        <p >
        We invite submissions for our upcoming <b>Special Track on Advancing Molecular Analysis with AI</b> at <a href="https://adma2025.github.io/">The 21st International Conference Advanced Data Mining and Applications
        2025 (ADMA 2025)</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p >Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming molecular analysis, revolutionizing how we identify, characterize, and design chemical compounds. 
            Traditional methods for molecular structure elucidation rely on labor-intensive spectral interpretation and heuristic-based computational techniques, 
            often requiring significant expertise and time to extract meaningful insights from complex data. 
            Such approaches can be prone to human error and are limited by the scope of pre-existing knowledge and computational power. 
            As the complexity of molecular systems increases, there is an urgent need for more efficient, scalable, and accurate techniques 
            to meet the growing demands of modern research.
        </p>
        <p>
        AI-driven approaches, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), 
        and diffusion models, provide a powerful data-driven paradigm for molecular analysis. These techniques facilitate automated spectral 
        annotation, de novo molecular generation, and predictive modeling of chemical properties, transforming the way molecular research is 
        conducted. Such advancements are particularly critical in fields like drug discovery, metabolomics, proteomics, and materials science, 
        where the need for rapid and accurate molecular characterization is essential for driving innovation and accelerating breakthroughs.
        </p>

        <p>
        Despite these promising developments, several challenges remain in applying AI to　molecular analysis, which include
            <li>Data scarcity and heterogeneity plague AI models, as high-quality, annotated spectral datasets (e.g., for rare metabolites or novel polymers) remain limited.</li>
            <li>Sparse, noisy, and instrument-dependent datasets often lack standardized annotations.</li>
            <li>The stochastic nature of molecular fragmentation in MS/MS data introduces uncertainty in spectral interpretation.</li>
            <li>Generalization from known to unknown compounds without sacrificing accuracy is still difficult due to the vast combinatorial chemical space.</li>
            <li>Generating chemically valid, synthesizable, and biologically relevant molecules requires additional constraints and physics-informed modeling.</li>
            <li>The "black-box" nature of many AI systems raises concerns about interpretability, particularly in regulated fields like pharmaceuticals, where validation is paramount.</li>
        </p>

        <p>
            Addressing these challenges with recent advancements in AI, such as large language models, will enhance AI's ability to extract meaningful representations 
            from spectral and structural data. AI's potential benefits in molecular analysis are profound: faster and more accurate compound identification, automated 
            drug design, efficient retrosynthesis planning, and the discovery of novel materials with tailored properties.
        </p>

        <p>
        This special session aims to bring together researchers from computational chemistry, cheminformatics, AI, and 
        analytical sciences to discuss recent advances in AI-driven molecular analysis, focusing on applications in mass spectrometry (MS), 
        nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular docking, and drug discovery. We welcome innovative AI methodologies that address challenges 
        such as noisy spectral data, fragmentation pattern prediction, small molecule generation, and multi-modal molecular analysis.
